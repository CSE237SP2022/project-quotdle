### What user stories were completed this iteration?
We completed the user stories that revolved around the basic structure of each of the files that control our game. We created the Game class to control the overall game that the user plays (user input, validation, and output). We also created a Wordle class to contain the state and functionality (like calculating which letters are correct in a user's guess) for the wordle game. Within all of this functionality are many other helper classes and methods we wrote to streamline our code. These helper classes also have user stories associated with them.

### What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
The bulk of our work for the next iteration revolves around converting our Wordle game into one that supports a Quotdle. A Quotdle is composed of multiple Wordles, so we will be able to reuse all the functionality we have written here. The various classes (and their methods and properties) will be broken into user stories that we can assign and test. 


### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
No, there is not.


### What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
