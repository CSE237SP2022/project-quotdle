# project-quotdle

### What user stories were completed this iteration?
This iteration, the user stories that were completed were focused on quality updates. Where before the individual Wordles contained under Quotdle had incorrect data about their past guesses (despite the data on Quotdle being correct), the Wordles now correctly fill with blank guesses when appropriate. Additionally, the quotes generated are no longer random arrays of three five letter words, but are instead now real quotes. Lastly, the Game class's access to the keyboard was simplified as it now correctly goes through Quotdle to get the Wordle-in-focus's keyboard.

### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
No, there is not.


### What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
To compile and run our code, use the build.sh bash script (./build.sh while in the root directory)
